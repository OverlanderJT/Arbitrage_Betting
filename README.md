# Arbitrage-Betting
This program allows the user to search through several different casinos and find profitable bets for an array of different sports using arbitrage betting.
Arbitrage betting is a strategy where someone places bets on a team to both win and lose in such a way that profit is guaranteed.
This program is meant to present the user with the information necessary to place bets and make money using arbitrage betting.

Future Plans:
A new file is created for every single casino. Within the casino file there are functions that collect and manipulate the data for every single sport into 2 names arrays and 2 bets arrays (for sports with only W/L) 2 Names arrays and 3 Bets arrays for sport with W/L/D.

Create an interactive GUI.
